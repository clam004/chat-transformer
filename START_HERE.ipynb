As training progresses the learning rate is also changing according to a scheduler that monitors the learning progress. `epochs` is the number of times we will cycle through the data during training. If you trained on the same dataset in a different sitting and would like to reload that trained model instead of training from scratch, simply paste this line of code below `model.load_state_dict(torch.load(opt.save_path))` before running it.
